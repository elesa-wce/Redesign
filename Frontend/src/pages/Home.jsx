          ELESA stands for Electronics Engineering Students' Association is a departmental Technical club of
            Electronics Department, established in 1992. Club comprises of the chief board, joint board and
            assistant board and has board strength of 65 board members. We idealize it's motto 'Integrated with
            Integrity'. Club provides a platform to all budding electronics engineers for a valuable exchange of
            ideas, and to bring out valuable decisions through scientific discussions .The club is being supported by
            faculty members and under their guidance and motivation, it has completed 32 years of its successful
            journey and will continue to do so. Here we arrange various events which tries to cover most of the
            engineering aspect of electronics engineering as well as other necessary fields according to the
            upgrading technology and need. The main motive is to impart knowledge and keep students in pace
            with the latest trends in technology. This is done by arranging various events, workshops, Hackathons,
            Ideathons, etc. and allowing students to take advantage by participating as well as arranging the
            events. Students here learn to solve, to present, to express, to innovate, to enjoy and to lead & these are
            major takeaways as an engineering student.
